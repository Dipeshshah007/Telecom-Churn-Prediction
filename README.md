📊 Telecom Churn Prediction

🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. Retaining an existing customer is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring a new one.
In this project, I developed a Machine Learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on demographic details, service usage patterns, and billing information.

The goal is to help telecom companies:
Identify high-risk customers
Take proactive retention actions
Reduce revenue loss
Improve customer lifetime value

📁 Dataset

File Used: Telco-Customer-Churn.csv
The dataset contains customer-level information including:
Demographics (gender, senior citizen, partner, dependents)
Services subscribed (internet, phone, streaming)
Account information (tenure, contract type, payment method)
Billing details (monthly charges, total charges)
Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

This dataset simulates real-world telecom customer behavior and churn patterns.
